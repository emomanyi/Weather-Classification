# Weather-Classification
Using image data we can classify whether the weather is cloudy, rainy, shiny or there is a sunrise

A deep neural network model (in `models/weather-2.ipynb` notebook )is used in classification, the Xception model was used as the base model and I added two more dense layers and dropour layers

The model can be tested in  https://anga-ml.herokuapp.com
